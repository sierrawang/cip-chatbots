export const RETRIEVAL_PROMPT2 = `**Task**: Based on the chat conversation and current context, determine if referencing course materials would be beneficial for the student.

**Instructions**:
1. Review the provided chat conversation and the current context.
2. Decide if it would be helpful for the student to reference any specific course materials to better understand the programming concepts being discussed.
3. If you determine that referencing materials would be helpful, identify the specific programming concept and the type of material that would be most helpful. Use only the concepts and material types listed in the previous sections of this document.

**JSON Response Format**:
Your response should be structured in JSON format as follows:
{
    "shouldReference": true/false, // true if referencing materials is beneficial, false otherwise
    "materials": {
        "concept": "Name_of_the_Concept", // replace with the relevant programming concept from the list
        "type": "Type_of_Material" // replace with the relevant type of material from the list
    }
}
Ensure that the values for "concept" and "type" are selected from the predefined lists provided earlier in this document.`
